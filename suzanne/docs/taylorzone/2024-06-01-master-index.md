 How to accomplish more by focusing on less.

'Atomic Habits' is the world’s most comprehensive guide on habit formation.

Here’s a brief, no-fluff summary of the most important and actionable ideas in the book:

𝟭. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗜𝘁 𝗢𝗯𝘃𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀:
Identify a habit you want to start. Place visible reminders around your environment. For instance, if you want to start reading more, leave a book on your pillow each morning after making your bed.

𝟮. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗜𝘁 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:
Combine a habit you need to do with one you want to do. For example, if you want to exercise but love watching TV, allow yourself to watch your favourite show only while working out.

𝟯. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗜𝘁 𝗘𝗮𝘀𝘆:
Simplify your new habit. If you're trying to eat healthier, prepare a week’s worth of healthy snacks on Sunday, so you have easy access to them throughout the week.

𝟰. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗜𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗳𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Reward yourself immediately after doing your new habit. If you’ve just completed a workout, treat yourself to a relaxing sauna.

𝟱. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝘄𝗼-𝗠𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲:
Break down your habits into tasks that can be started in under two minutes. If you want to practice an instrument daily, start with just playing for two minutes, and you’ll inevitably continue for longer.

𝟲. 𝗛𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Link a new habit to an existing one. After brushing your teeth (existing habit), immediately do two minutes of meditation (new habit).

𝟳. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝘄 𝗼𝗳 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁:
Arrange your environment to support your new habits. If you’re trying to stop doom-scrolling late at night, leave your phone outside of your bedroom.

𝟴. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲:
Habits should be neither too hard nor too easy. If you're learning a language, don’t try to read a complex novel right away; start with a simple article.

𝟵. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗙𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀:
Share your goals with friends or family. Join or create a group where members hold each other accountable for their habits, like a book club.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗛𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁𝘀:
Keep a habit tracker to make progress visible and keep you motivated. This could be a simple calendar where you mark each day you complete your habit or an app that helps you monitor your progress.

💬 What's a habit you've formed, and how did you make it stick?

We can think, even if our language abilities are destroyed by a stroke.
Language is a way to express thoughts, but thoughts, memories, and reasoning exist without language.

Favorite quote from this MIT piece: "This language system seems to be distinct from regions that are linked to our ability to plan, remember, reminisce on past and future, reason in social situations, experience empathy, make moral decisions, and construct one’s self-image. Thus, vast portions of our everyday cognitive experiences appear to be unrelated to language per se

[01/04/2024, 08:10:42] Peter: The BIS has recently launched a new initiative to support researchers and central banking enthusiasts. For many years, we have been publishing select speeches delivered by senior central bankers on our website. These are popular with researchers, for example as a heat map of which topics are on policymakers’ minds. To make research even more convenient, we've now introduced a pre-compiled full text extract of the speeches delivered by central bankers since 1996. 📚

Accessing these files is simple! You can either manually download them from our website, at <https://bit.ly/4ay1Wav>, or use our open-source library, gingado <https://bit.ly/3VBisme>,  to easily download the content programmatically with a few keystrokes (see image) 🎤

Feel free to use this content for noncommercial purposes, in line with the BIS terms and conditions. We hope this new resource will be beneficial for your research and central banking studies. 🔬

Happy exploring, and don't forget to share your findings with us! 💡

[18/03/2024, 18:29:02] Peter: We can think, even if our language abilities are destroyed by a stroke.
Language is a way to express thoughts, but thoughts, memories, and reasoning exist without language.

Favorite quote from this MIT piece: "This language system seems to be distinct from regions that are linked to our ability to plan, remember, reminisce on past and future, reason in social situations, experience empathy, make moral decisions, and construct one’s self-image. Thus, vast portions of our everyday cognitive experiences appear to be unrelated to language per se

[01/04/2024, 08:10:42] Peter: The BIS has recently launched a new initiative to support researchers and central banking enthusiasts. For many years, we have been publishing select speeches delivered by senior central bankers on our website. These are popular with researchers, for example as a heat map of which topics are on policymakers’ minds. To make research even more convenient, we've now introduced a pre-compiled full text extract of the speeches delivered by central bankers since 1996. 📚

Accessing these files is simple! You can either manually download them from our website, at https://bit.ly/4ay1Wav, or use our open-source library, gingado https://bit.ly/3VBisme,  to easily download the content programmatically with a few keystrokes (see image) 🎤

Feel free to use this content for noncommercial purposes, in line with the BIS terms and conditions. We hope this new resource will be beneficial for your research and central banking studies. 🔬

Happy exploring, and don't forget to share your findings with us! 💡
